Welcome to my Website! I’m a dual-degree BS/MS student at Haverford College and Bryn Mawr College with a background in physics and a growing focus on ML systems, hardware-aware machine learning, and efficient computation.

I'm currently doing research at Bryn Mawr College with the [Nanomaterials and Spintronics Group](https://www.brynmawr.edu/XMCheng) in collaboration wtih the [Center for Quantum Materials and Sensing](https://www.brynmawr.edu/academics/centers-institutes-projects/qmsec-center/people) where I work on computational and data-driven aspects of materials research..
