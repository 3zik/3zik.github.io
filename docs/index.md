Welcome to my Website! I’m a dual-degree BS/MS student at Haverford College and Bryn Mawr College with a background in condensed matter physics and a growing focus on ML systems, hardware-aware machine learning, and efficient GPU computation.

I'm currently doing research at Bryn Mawr College with the [Nanomaterials and Spintronics Group](https://www.brynmawr.edu/XMCheng) in collaboration wtih the [Center for Quantum Materials and Sensing](https://www.brynmawr.edu/academics/centers-institutes-projects/qmsec-center/people) where I work on computational and data-driven aspects of materials research. Read more about my research [HERE](research/overview.md).

Read about my personal projects [HERE](projects.md).

## I'm Currently Working on...

- Profiling and optimizing a graph neural network workload on GPUs, with a focus on memory behavior, kernel efficiency, and hardware-aware ML performance.
