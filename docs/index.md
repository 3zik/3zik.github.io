# Ethan Furman

Welcome to my website! I’m a dual-degree BS/MS student at Haverford College and Bryn Mawr College with a background in condensed matter physics and a growing interest in ML systems.

I'm currently doing research at Bryn Mawr College with the [Nanomaterials and Spintronics Group](https://www.brynmawr.edu/XMCheng) in collaboration with the [Center for Quantum Materials and Sensing](https://www.brynmawr.edu/academics/centers-institutes-projects/qmsec-center/people) where I work on computational quantum materials research. Read more about my research [HERE](research/overview.md).

Read about my personal projects [HERE](projects.md).

Feel free to [contact me here](contact.md).

## I'm Currently Working on...

> Studying the Magnetic Proximity Effect in magnetic multilayer systems

> Applying Neural Networks to solve the Schrodinger Equation

> Learning more about CUDA and GPU Acceleration
