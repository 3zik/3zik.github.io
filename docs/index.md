Welcome to my website! I'm a dual-degree BS/MS student at Haverford College and Bryn Mawr College interested in Physics, ML, and Computing. This site contains information about my personal projects, research, and self-guided study in ML, CS, and physics. See notes, problem sets, and code.

I'm currently doing research at Bryn Mawr College with the [Nanomaterials and Spintronics Group](https://www.brynmawr.edu/XMCheng) and in associate with the [Center for Quantum Materials and Sensing](https://www.brynmawr.edu/academics/centers-institutes-projects/qmsec-center/people).
