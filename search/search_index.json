Computed full phonon dispersion relations including flexural (ZA) modes and implemented Bose\u2013Einstein-based heat capacity calculations in Python. Validated results against experimental data and DFT literature, reproducing characteristic low-temperature T\u00b2 scaling and analyzing anharmonic effects at high temperatures. Presented my findings in a ten-minute talk. Tools: Python, Phonons, Lattice Modeling Dates: Oct 2025 \u2013 Dec 2025 Toy NETS Simulation of Rare-Event Dynamics Implemented a Python simulation comparing standard Langevin dynamics with a drift-augmented \u201ctoy NETS\u201d model in a 1D double-well potential (inspired by Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden, 2025). Explored connections between stochastic modeling and rare-event sampling theory. Tools: Python, Stochastic Differential Equations Dates: June 2025 \u2013 Sept 2025 Energy Levels and Wavefunctions of Alkali Atoms Calculations Built a finite-difference eigenvalue solver in Python to compute quantum energy spectra using large tridiagonal Hamiltonian matrices. Implemented adaptive convergence and grid-resolution control to ensure numerical stability and precision for large-scale scientific simulations. Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Numerical Linear Algebra, Quantum Mechanics Comparing ML Algorithm Detection for Development of an Artificially Intelligent Radiologist Developed and compared multiple ML models for radiology (ResNets, DenseNets) using Stanford\u2019s MURA dataset of 40,561 MSK radiographs. Performed statistical evaluation (Cohen\u2019s Kappa, ROC curves, AUROC, McNemar\u2019s Test) and visualized AI-generated data. Produced a written research report and presented findings in a ten-minute talk.
